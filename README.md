# Project description
The purpose of the project was to find out the best algorithm for predicting the quality of wine basing on a variety of features as shown in the dataset "winequality.csv" file.

We used four algorithms that included random forest, decision tree, support vector and logistic regression. The final algorithm we chose to implement was support vector machine and was further tuned as shown in the notebook.
